①This connector connects to I2C of Pressure Sensor MS5837-30BA.

②The piezoelectric buzzer connected to pin 8 of Arduino Uno.

③This is a logic level conversion module for communicating between Arduino's 5V and 3.3V sensors via I2C.
Pressure Sensor MS5837-30BA and gyro sensor MPU-6050 are connected.

④This is a 6 axis gyro sensor MPU-6050 for recording the attitude of the payload.

⑤The 2pin connector prepared to send the PWM signal from the 8-pin with a buzzer,
 and at the same time send a start signal to the external microphone terminal of the action camera. 
We use a 10μF capacitor and two 100K ohm as a simple voltage divider circuit next to the buzzer to match the level of the mini pin.
