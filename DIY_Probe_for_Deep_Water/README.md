We built and tested several prototypes, including a model with the circuit immersed in oil inside a bottle to prevent water intrusion due to water pressure, a small logger made of an acrylic case machined with a laser cutter for cost effectiveness, and a model that uses an underwater drone housing. The model shown below is equipped with lights, action cameras, hydrophones, and data loggers. This prototype has fishing weights added to offset the buoyancy of the payload. It was also connected to a fishing rod line to collect data at depths of over 200 meters.
