We built and tested several prototypes, including a model with the circuit immersed in oil inside a bottle to prevent water intrusion due to water pressure, a small logger made of an acrylic case machined with a laser cutter for cost effectiveness, and a model that uses an underwater drone housing. The model shown below is equipped with lights, an action camera, a hydrophone, and a data logger. And to offset the buoyancy of the payload, we added fishing weights to balance it, and we present a prototype that successfully collected data at depths in excess of 200 meters.
